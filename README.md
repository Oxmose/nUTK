## UTK - Utility Kernel

* UTK is a kernel created for training and educational purposes. It is designed to execute in kernel mode only.

* UTK has a configuration file allowing the kernel to be customized depending on the system it will run on.

* UTK can be build with its own bootloader or use GRUB as bootloader.

## Architecture supported
| i386 | x86_64 | ARM |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  YES |   TBD | TBD |

### Memory Management

* Higher-half kernel
* Virtual/physical memory allocator
* Process isolation

### Synchronization

* Futex based synchronization
* Mutex: Non recursive/Recursive - Priority inheritance capable. Futex based
* Semaphore: FIFO based, priority of the locking thread is not relevant to select the next thread to unlock. Futex based
* Spinlocks
* Kernel critical section by disabling interrupts

### Scheduler

* Priority based scheduler (threads can change their priority at execution time)
* Round Robin for all the threads having the same priority

### Process / Thread management

* Fork / WaitPID
* Kernel threads support
* System calls

### BSP Support: i386/x86_64

* PIC and IO-APIC support (PIC supported but IO APIC required)
* Local APIC support with timers
* PIT support (can be used as an auxiliary timer source)
* RTC support
* Basic ACPI support (simple parsing used to enable multicore features)
* Serial output support
* Interrupt API (handlers can be set by the user)
* 80x25 16colors VGA support
* Time management API.

## Roadmap
You can see the planned tasks / features in the project's kanban on GitHub.

----------
## Build and run
To build UTK, choose the architecture you want and execute.

Architecture list to use in the TARGET flag:
* x86_i386
### Compilation
make target=[TARGET] TESTS=[TRUE/FALSE] DEBUG=[TRUE/FALSE]

### Execution
make target=[TARGET] run

### Tests and Debug
* The user can compile with the TESTS flag set to TRUE to enable internal testing
* The user can compile with the DEBUG flag set to TRUE to enable debuging support (-O0 -g3)
